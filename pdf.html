                        your
                        score and increase the value of your business. If you register more intellectual property and
                        create
                        more intellectual assets, there can be several effects. Your business will be more innovative
                        and
                        creative and generate greater customer engagement and loyalty. It can be more resilient to
                        survive
                        downturns. It will be more attractive to investors who value IP and intangible assets, and
                        business
                        valuation can be higher.

                                This
                                is now changing world wide. There are many ways to help women create and own more IP;

                                growing trend to use IP to empower women more as well as to encourage and support larger
                                numbers of female entrepreneurs and their businesses. Female owned and/or operated

                                you only need Indonesian IP protection. However, if you are expanding overseas, or plan

                        Formally registering your IP can increase and protect value in a business, and is worth

                        Registered rights help to create a sustainable and defensible barrier to entry for your
                        competitors
                        by
                        providing you with a monopoly over the use of a particular name, mark, invention or design. For
                        example, the 'first to file' trade mark system in Indonesia means the first person to apply gets
                        the
                        legal
                        rights to a trademark.

                    <p>
                        A new invention or design that is not filed quickly will become unprotectable, owing to the
                        official
                        criteria that govern the application process (see below). Licensing will be much easier if your
                        rights are
                        formally recognized. Investors take considerable comfort from the presence of registered IP
                        rights,
                        and lenders are becoming increasingly aware of the role they play in protecting cashflows.

                        Designs and patents can only be registered if they are new and have not been disclosed (subject
                        to a
                        few defined exceptions, such as under an NDA). So, if you have not registered any invention or
                        design
                        now, but you already used or disclosed it (for example, by putting it on public display), it is
                        no
                        longer
                        “novel” and cannot be registered. What this means is whenever a new invention or design is
                        created,
                        you need to consider whether you should register it immediately. If a patent application is
                        successful,
                        and your patent is granted, you will have annual maintenance fees to pay which increases over
                        time.

                        Almost every company uses a distinctive name and many also have a distinctive logo. Some
                        companies
                        have slogans, sounds, colours or other marks as well as domain names that they use to help
                        customers
                        identify their products from those offered by competitors. All of these things can be registered
                        as
                        trade marks. Registering a trade mark is relatively inexpensive and makes it much easier to stop
                        others
                        using confusingly similar marks to you. Trade marks also make it much easier to license your
                        products
                        and allow you to use the ® mark next to your name. Unlike patents and designs, trademarks can be
                        registered at any time; however, the risk is that if you do not register early, others may
                        register
                        first
                        and may force you to stop using a name you prefer. The best practice is to search to check no
                        one
                        has
                        a prior similar mark registered, then file early on. Remember to renew your trade marks every 10
                        years.

                        Copyright does not have to be registered in order to exist. To be able to enforce your
                        copyright,
                        the
                        most important evidence to retain is proof of your creative process, i.e. the workings leading
                        up to
                        the
                        final version. Official registration is possible in Indonesia; it is generally recommended only
                        to
                        register
                        the most important works that you will continue to use for a long time in the same form, or
                        where
                        you
                        are aware there is a possible dispute.

                        It is important that that all IP is owned by the business. It is common to own IP in personal
                        names
                        of
                        shareholders and directors in Indonesia, but this is not a good business practice. It creates
                        additional
                        costs and risks, especially if the IP needs to be enforced, or someone accuses your business of
                        infringement (you may end up being personally liable). Also, IP not owned by the business may
                        not be
                        counted by investors. Technically, license agreements must be signed and recorded with those
                        individuals (but in practice this is costly and rare). All businesses should carefully check and
                        if
                        necessary, assign to the business all IP not held in the business’ name using a short contract,
                        which
                        then has to be registered at Dirjen Haki.

                        There are two purposes to registering IP. One is to protect your business model. It is usually
                        worth
                        analysing the IP you have registered in the light of your current trading activities. Is
                        everything
                        you
                        offer protected in some way? Having the right IP registrations gives you a way to stop third
                        parties
                        interfering with your business.

                    <p>
                        The second purpose is to stop others from copying you. You should at least consider this and
                        decide
                        how you want to respond. If you don’t have the right IP registrations, you may not be able to
                        take
                        any
                        action against them at all.

                        (e.g.

                        works
                        such as photographs and graphics made specially for your business. If you have none of these,
                        you
                        should definitely consider creating some or all of them. This extra IP will strengthen your
                        business
                        model and boost your value.

                        To protect your copyright, it is good practice to display the copyright symbol (©) and wording
                        such
                        as
                        <strong>'Copyright [organisation name] [date]. All rights reserved'</strong> on all relevant
                        materials, including
                        websites and all printed documentation.

                    <p>
                        The most common mistake made by business with copyright is failing to own it properly. By
                        default,
                        every copyright work created is owned by its author or creator(s). There are two exceptions.
                        Firstly,
                        where a company employee created it, and their employment contract contains a provision that all
                        IP
                        is owned by the company. Secondly, where an independent contractor or designer created it, but
                        there is a contract with that person which specifically assigns ownership to the business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Business owners should get into the habit of checking that each contract has this provision,
                        called
                        an
                        IP assignment clause. If you have not done so, go back through previous contracts where works
                        have
                        been created for you. If there is no agreement in place, ask the author to sign a very simple
                        document
                        assigning the copyright to your business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One other risk to guard against is the possibility that you are infringing other people’s
                        copyright,
                        and
                        that they could sue you. It is very easy to take material from the internet and re-use it, but
                        doing
                        so
                        may get your business in trouble – always check the licensing conditions for assets like images.
                        It
                        is
                        especially important to ensure that software you develop, or ask others to develop for you, does
                        not
                        ‘borrow’ code or other content from other parties that are not freely available under open
                        source

                        Now we will consider other intangible assets, which we call ‘Intellectual Assets’ to help you
                        think
                        of
                        them as having broadly similar importance to IP rights. We have organised these into categories
                        to
                        make them easier for you to find. Some of these may in fact be eligible for legal protection as
                        intellectual property if the right steps are taken to secure them. Where possible, always try to
                        ‘upgrade’ intellectual assets to intellectual property, to gain legal protection and fair
                        recognition.

                    <p>
                        These assets are important for financial performance in an organization and should be identified
                        and
                        accounted for in strategic decision-making and investment. There is a strong correlation between
                        good
                        management of intellectual assets and the overall success of a firm.

                                The Contracts section covers all the types of legally binding arrangements that are
                                relevant
                                for your
                                business. All businesses depend on contracts; usually these will be written, covering
                                all
                                the terms that
                                have been agreed, and will be signed by both parties. You should not start trading with
                                another
                                business (even pay a deposit) until you have a signed contract – this is the most common
                                source of
                                disputes. If you are dealing directly with the public you should normally have written
                                terms
                                and
                                conditions that set out what you are agreeing to provide.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even without a written document, a contract can still exist – it may be oral or implied
                                -
                                but that is far
                                less secure and not as valuable. So, it is recommended that all contracts are done
                                properly
                                – in writing,
                                covering all the terms and signed by both parties. It is possible to have them created
                                after
                                an event –
                                this is recommended if you have forgotten to do it at the time. Some special times of
                                contracts may
                                need to be registered – for land, for IP etc.

                                Most businesses should have the following Contracts in place: Employment agreements for
                                staff,
                                Customer orders and Supplier contracts (for business-to business companies) and standard
                                Terms &
                                Conditions (more commonly for consumers). Manufacturing companies will often have
                                Agent/distributor agreements to cover rights to sell their products. Marketing contracts
                                for social
                                media, websites and agencies are common. Non-employees such as sub-contractors will have
                                consulting agreements.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Licensing and franchising agreements are also forms of contracts. Both can provide an
                                excellent way
                                to generate more income from the other IP and intellectual assets you own as a business.
                                Franchising
                                is particularly popular in retail.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Agreements should always cover who owns any IP created under them. Smart businesses keep
                                a
                                contracts log, such as an Excel spreadsheet with basic contract information, as well as
                                a secure location
                                for the originals. Always use NDAs before disclosing any sensitive information to
                                another
                                person/party. Lastly, if a business has multiple shareholders/owners there should be a
                                shareholders
                                or partnership agreement (although this would not usually relate to IP or intangible
                                assets).

                                Many internal resource assets are commercially sensitive and rely on confidentiality to
                                maintain their
                                value. Ensure that appropriate physical and electronic measures are in place to
                                safeguard the
                                confidentiality of any know-how you consider proprietary, and that employment contracts
                                contain
                                relevant clauses to ensure staff respect this.

                                ‘reverse engineering’, it might be patentable. Similarly, a Unique service format or

                                experience can be documented (to attract copyright protection) and branded (which can
                                then be
                                safeguarded using a trade mark).

                                Trade secrets, if properly protected and securely held, may qualify for legal
                                protection. Data may be
                                important in other ways; not only can data itself be a valuable trade secret, but
                                special data privacy
                                laws and regulations may apply. Advice should be taken on how to protect data to avoid
                                liability for
                                misuse.

                                Unregistered trade marks should be registered if they have value and are in use. If not,
                                you take the
                                risk that another business registers a similar mark and requires you to stop using
                                yours. Ideally, search
                                first before settling on a name for your business, product or service, to make sure
                                there is no prior
                                similar trade mark.

                                Unregistered designs usually cannot be protected, but if you have identified this type
                                of asset, you
                                should ask yourself whether it should have been registered – this may be a lesson for
                                future designs
                                you create.
